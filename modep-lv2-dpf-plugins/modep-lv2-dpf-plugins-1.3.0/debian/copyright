 This extension is a generic transport mechanism for time stamped events

 events of any type; the type of events and timestamps are defined by a URI
 which is mapped to an integer by the host for performance reasons.

 C header for the LV2 URI Map extension <http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/uri-map>.
 .
 This extension defines a simple mechanism for plugins to map URIs to
 integers, usually for performance reasons (e.g. processing events typed by
 URIs in real time). The expected use case is for plugins to map URIs to
 integers for things they 'understand' at instantiation time, and store those
 values for use in the audio thread without doing any string comparison.
 This allows the extensibility of RDF with the performance of integers (or
 centrally defined enumerations).

 This file provides an API for constructing Atoms which makes it relatively
 simple to build nested atoms of arbitrary complexity without requiring
 dynamic memory allocation.
 .
 The API is based on successively appending the appropriate pieces to build a
 complete Atom.  The size of containers is automatically updated.  Functions
 that begin a container return (via their frame argument) a stack frame which
 must be popped when the container is finished.
 .
 All output is written to a user-provided buffer or sink function.  This
 makes it popssible to create create atoms on the stack, on the heap, in LV2
 port buffers, in a ringbuffer, or elsewhere, all using the same API.
 .
 This entire API is realtime safe if used with a buffer or a realtime safe
